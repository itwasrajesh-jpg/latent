/**
 * What a set of reference images says about grain, halation, bloom and glare.
 *
 * These four are not guessed at by the search: each leaves a signature that can be read straight
 * off a photograph, which is both faster and more truthful than trying thousands of renders
 * until the texture happens to match.
 *
 *  - **Grain** is fine noise that survives in flat areas, where the picture has no detail of its
 *    own. Measured by how much a pixel differs from its neighbours where the neighbourhood is
 *    otherwise smooth.
 *  - **Halation** is a red-orange bleed that appears only around bright edges. Measured by how
 *    much redder the surroundings of a highlight are than the picture as a whole.
 *  - **Bloom** is a wider lift around bright areas without the red bias — the diffusion filter.
 *    Measured at a larger radius than halation, and separated from it by colour.
 *  - **Glare** is veiling flare: the black point rising when the frame is bright overall.
 *    Measured as how far the darkest tones sit above zero in a bright picture.
