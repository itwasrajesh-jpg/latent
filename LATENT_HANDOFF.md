# LATENT — Master Handoff

*Film camera for Android by Celestial. State as of 12 Sep 2026 (app step 8a; engine patch written, not yet uploaded).*
*Purpose: everything a fresh session needs. Paste this at the start of a new conversation.*

---

## 1. What Latent is

A film camera, not an editor. Shoot RAW, the photo develops through spektrafilm's physically
based simulation (spectral exposure → dye density → print → scan). Free and open source
(GPLv3). Package `com.celestial.latent`, repo `github.com/itwasrajesh-jpg/latent` (public).

## 2. Working method

- Phone-only development: GitHub web editor + Actions. No Codespaces, no PC.
- Code arrives as zip bundles → upload to repo root or `drop/` → `drop.yml` unpacks and commits.
- **Builds are manual**: Actions → "Build Latent APK" → Run workflow. APK on the Releases page.
- Workflow files are pasted by hand (a workflow cannot edit workflows).
- Engine + LibRaw are fetched at build time from the user's mirror at a pinned commit
  (`ENGINE_REPO` / `ENGINE_REF` in build.yml). arm64 only. JDK 21, NDK 27.0.12077973, CMake 3.22.1.
- Build errors: the `e: file:///…` lines are what's needed. Crashes: the app shows the trace
  on next launch with a Share button. Runtime behaviour: only the phone can verify.
- The user's preferences: plain language throughout, aesthetics considered in the first
  version rather than added later, ask before big or risky changes, small steps.

## 3. Device facts (Xiaomi 15 Ultra, Android 16)

- Camera2 LEVEL_3. Logical camera 0 with physical 2 (main 23 mm, 1-inch, f/1.63), 3 (UW 14 mm),
  4 (70 mm, ISO max 1119), 5 (100 mm). Extra logical cameras 6 and 7 exist.
- Third-party RAW: 12.5 MP, **10-bit** (white 1023, black 64) on every lens; no 50 MP for
  outside apps. Colour matrices, noise profile and shading map all present and matching
  Xiaomi's own Pro-mode RAW.
- RAW burst runs at a true 30 fps with no drops.
- Camera Extensions available: AUTOMATIC, BOKEH, NIGHT (front camera too).
- `JPEG_R` (Ultra HDR) is offered but **cannot share a session with RAW** — the driver throws a
  fatal error. Ultra HDR was removed.
- **Measured dead ends**: DCG, staggered HDR, multi-frame HDR, snapshot HDR and MFNR vendor keys
  are accepted but have *zero* measurable effect on the RAW (A/B tested at ISO 390 and 3112,
  ±0.01). The driver publishes no vendor result keys, so "echo=1" means "not rejected", nothing
  more. Ideal RAW times out in every stream layout. All those toggles were removed.
- **What is real**: in-sensor zoom on the JPEG path (main lens), `sensor_meta_data.current_mode`
  as a route to sensor-crop RAW on the telephotos (MotionCam uses mode 38 on lens 5), the
  Camera Extensions, and our own aligned stacking.
- Vendor codes are per-lens in the app; a mode valid on one sensor errors on another.

## 4. Engine facts

**The port ships `.claude/skills`, including `spectrafilm-dev` — read it before touching the
C++.** Its hard laws: parity with the Python oracle is the prime directive (max_abs ≤ 1e-4,
rms ≤ 1e-5, byte-identical across thread counts); any change under
`engine/spektra-core/src/main/cpp/**` must keep the host-parity suite green before it is done;
non-parity behaviour must default OFF; NDK r27 / CMake 3.22.1 / JDK 21 are hard pins;
`-fno-finite-math-only` must never be stripped (the scan stage relies on NaN propagation);
stochastic stages need fixed seeds; thread-invariance is mandatory; GPU never routes export or
parity; and never claim the parity gate passed without running it.

- `engine:spektra-core` (C++ + Kotlin facade) and `lib:libraw`, fetched from the mirror.
- API used: `simulate`, `simulatePreview` (the only path honouring the GPU preview flag),
  `bakeCubeLut`, `meterExposureEv`, `listProfiles`.
- Input must be **linear ProPhoto**: the engine ignores the colour-space label and always
  interprets input as ProPhoto. RAW arrives that way from LibRaw; JPEG sources are converted
  in `Develop.openImage` (sRGB curve removed, then sRGB→ProPhoto primaries).
- Output: the scan stage converts to the chosen space with correct matrices, CAT02 adaptation
  and per-space encoding. sRGB is correct for viewing; wide spaces are for onward grading and
  can band in an 8-bit JPEG.
- 20 filming profiles, 8 printing profiles. Each film declares its `target_print`: Kodak
  negatives → Portra Endura, Fuji → Crystal Archive II, Vision3/Verita → Kodak 2383. Slide
  films (Provia, Velvia, Ektachrome, Kodachrome) have none and need `scanFilm = true`.
  Using a printing profile as a film gives "internal error".
- **Performance**: the diffusion filter is a direct 2D convolution in float64 with radius
  = 8 × bloom λ (capped at half the image), so cost is O(pixels × radius²) — minutes at
  12.5 MP. It is already multithreaded. Everything else is seconds. Previews therefore drop
  the spatial stages (grain, halation, diffusion, glare) unless that tab is open.
- Known cost profile: 800 px preview ≈ 300–500 ms; full 12.5 MP ≈ 10–20 s without diffusion.
- **Diffusion is the one expensive stage**, and the port has already measured it: a scene with
  halation + diffusion at 0.8 took 49.2 s → 13.4 s after they parallelised it, on a 4-core
  desktop at 3 MP. Minutes at 12.5 MP on a phone is expected, not a bug. Previews therefore drop
  the spatial stages unless that tab is open, and the UI warns before a slow export.
- **The film look is not tied to any colour space.** The simulation works in 81 spectral bands
  and dye density; only the final scan stage converts to RGB, with correct per-space matrices,
  CAT02 adaptation and encoding curves. sRGB output is authentic for viewing; ProPhoto/ACES are
  for onward grading and band in an 8-bit JPEG.
- **Exposure looks like it does nothing on the print route** — by design. `print_exposure_compensation`
  and `normalize_print_exposure` (both on by default in the engine) recompute the enlarger exposure
  from the film exposure, exactly as a printer would. Film exposure changes where the negative sits
  on the curve (contrast, crossover), not print brightness. Brightness on the print route is
  **Print exposure**. Those two switches are not yet exposed in the app — TODO.
- GPU (Vulkan) covers the **scan stage only** and is **preview-only by the engine's own rule**
  (its float maths is not bit-reproducible across vendors, so export and the parity path must
  stay CPU). The app therefore exposes a GPU *preview* switch only, and `Develop.render` forces
  it off for full renders. Do not re-add a GPU export option. Measurements so far were taken on
  a throttled phone and are inconclusive; a guarded "Measure GPU vs CPU" button is in the
  ENGINE tab.
- **Local engine change (pending upload)**: the diffusion filter *family* was fixed to
  black_pro_mist in the C API, so Glimmerglass / Pro-Mist / Cinebloom were silently ignored.
  Patch bundle `engine-diffusion-family.zip` adds the field to `spektra.h`, honours it in
  `spektra.cpp` (with fallback), maps the Kotlin string in `spektra_jni.cpp`, and documents it
  in the mirror's NOTICE. After committing it, `ENGINE_REF` in build.yml must be updated.

## 6. Where things stand, and what is planned

### Done and shipped (app steps 1 → 8a)
Camera, burst + alignment, Xiaomi extensions, engine integration, auto-develop, roll, darkroom
with the full parameter surface, film↔paper pairing, About/credits, cancellable developing,
per-lens vendor codes, GPU export removed (engine rule), and — in 8a — the viewfinder drawn by
the app itself, ready to carry a film look.

### Immediately open
1. **Engine patch not uploaded.** `engine-diffusion-family.zip` passes the diffusion filter family
   through the C API. Until it is committed to the mirror and `ENGINE_REF` updated, Glimmerglass /
   Pro-Mist / Cinebloom are decorative — the engine always renders Black Pro-Mist. Either upload it
   or grey those three out.
2. **Move `ENGINE_REF` forward.** The pin is 28 Aug; upstream committed as recently as 12 Sep. A
   free update, possibly including GPU work.
3. **8b — the film look in the viewfinder.** 8a built the path with a neutral table; 8b bakes the
   table from the current recipe (`bakeCubeLut`) and applies the engine's own exposure gain
   (`meterExposureEv`), so the live view matches what develops. Live view carries colour and tone
   only; grain, halation and diffusion arrive on development, and the caption says so.
4. **Print exposure compensation switches** in the ENLARGER tab (see §4), so film exposure can be
   made to change brightness.

### Planned, in rough order
- **Film look builder from an uploaded JPEG** — the project's most distinctive idea. Measure a
  numerical *fingerprint* of a reference image's look (shadow level, contrast roll-off, grey lean,
  saturation vs brightness, skin and sky behaviour) rather than comparing pixel to pixel, then
  search inside the film physics — film, paper, exposure, contrast, push, filtration, couplers —
  for the closest recipe, trialling at postcard size with the spatial stages off. Because profiles
  are curve data, the search can **interpolate between films**, so the answer can be a new emulsion
  (e.g. 62% Portra 400 + 38% Vision3 250T on Supra Endura) that the user names and tunes. Honest
  limits: some looks are outside film's reach — report a match percentage; black and white needs a
  monochrome profile path, since blending colour films only desaturates; generated profiles are
  CC BY-SA 4.0 derivatives and must be named as Celestial stocks, never as Kodak/Fuji/Leica
  products. **First step: build the fingerprint measurement alone** and show it across several
  films, to check the numbers separate looks the way the eye does.
- **Lens discovery** — the lens table is hard-coded to this phone's IDs; a Pixel shows wrong chips.
  Derive lenses from the characteristics (focal length, sensor size → 35 mm equivalent) at startup.
- **Colour tab polish** — add Display P3 (the phone's own screen) and Rec.709 with the video curve;
  label each option by what it is *for*; keep gamut compression labelled as the look control it is.
- **Film preview in the Xiaomi Portrait/Night modes** — deliberately deferred.
- **Freeze-frame preview** — render the current frame through the real engine at low resolution,
  so grain and halation can be judged before shooting.
- **Latent Looks + HALD import** of Lightroom presets.
- **Own depth-based bokeh** (Depth Anything-class model + segmentation + our own blur in linear
  light), which works on RAW and on any lens, unlike Xiaomi's.

### Decided against, with reasons
- **A GPU port of the engine.** The port already ships a Vulkan host and the scan-stage shaders;
  the author has the expose/print kernels on his roadmap with test tooling (`tools/gpu_probe`), and
  both his repo and vkdt had commits on 12 Sep. Duplicating it would likely be wasted effort —
  move the pin forward instead, and contribute upstream if the itch persists. vkdt's filmsim
  (GPLv3, fp32, 41 bands) is the legal, sanctioned shader seed if it is ever attempted.
- **Diffusion micro-optimisation in C++** — float32 would break bit-exactness with the oracle, so
  by the engine's rules it must be opt-in and default off, and any change needs their host-parity
  suite run. Not a small patch.
- **Ultra HDR**, **DCG / staggered HDR / MFHDR / snapshot HDR / MFNR** — measured dead, removed.

## 7. Testing habits that work

- Settings → Logs → "Latent only" → Clear → do the thing → Refresh → Share.
- Measure, don't assume: the A/B test and the sensor-mode sweep settled questions that
  metadata could not.
- Nothing heavy runs twice at once: developing is single-lane. A hot phone throttles hard and
  makes every timing meaningless — measure cool.
